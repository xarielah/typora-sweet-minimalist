# Sweet-Minimalist Theme



My customized and adjusted version for “GitHub dark dimmed” CSS for typora’s markdown editor. Hope you’ll enjoy it.

### Why Typora?

Recently I’ve encountered the need for a quality and solid markdown editor for my courses, meetings, basically to be able to spill out ideas and have tasks, points etc.. written down in a way that I would be having the need for creating a Word or OneNote or any other robust and out-of-proportion solution in comparison for my needs.

After investigating some solutions, most were paid ones with a free trial period offered, and checking Typora was almost the last one I tried.

I fell in love with it immediately.

I can customize CSS-based themes and use variety of fonts, plus having a spell live spelling checker and I really love it!

Of course most will offer these but [Typora.io](https://typora.io) is offering a one-time license, use it up to 3 devices and it works great.

It opens very fast, in-contrast of some other products I tried, and the configuration options are very wide.



###### This isn’t sponsored btw, I really am enjoying this product!
